import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

ZeFer blog posts uses [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) for it's WYSIWYG editor and uploaded it to our database via JSON.
You can not parse the JSON `content` without a converter. We made an npm package for this.

### Install `zefer-lib` 

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">
    ```txt
    npm i zefer-lib
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```txt
    yarn i zefer-lib
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
