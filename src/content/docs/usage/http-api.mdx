The ZeFer blog posts can currently only be accessed through the HTTP API, which requires Bearer Token Authentication. Before proceeding, ensure that you have created an account on ZeFer. The API is hosted on [render.com](https://render.com/).

To get your blog posts on ZeFer, use the URL below and don't forget to insert your API key on the Bearer Token Authentication when requesting.

```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { getHtml, getText, getPost, getPosts } from "zefer-lib";

const getPost = await getPost(process.env.ZEFER_API_KEY as string, 'POST_ID or SLUG/TITLE_ID'); // get specific post
const getPosts = await getPosts(process.env.ZEFER_API_KEY as string, { // get all posts
    limit: 10,
    search: "search query",
});

const html = getHtml(getPost.content); // get HTML of the blog post content
const text = getText(getPost.content); // get plain text of the blog post content
```
